Today's Top Spotlight Game
Braves vs Reds by James Boutros













The Atlanta Braves will be on the road as they take on the Cincinnati Reds. Jared Shuster will take the mound for the Braves. Granot spam Ashcraft is expected to be the starting pitcher for the Reds. Jared Shuster is expected to start for the Braves. He went 5.2 innings and gave up five hits, three walks, one earned run, and struck out two in a win in his last start against the Colorado Rockies. On the season, he has a record of 4-2 with a 4.57 ERA, 1.38 WHIP, and a 23/22 K/BB ratio in eight starts. Opposing batters are hitting .233 against Shuster.

The Braves have been very good on offense this season. They are top 10 in the league in runs, hits, home runs, RBIs, batting average, OBP, SLG, and OPS. Matt Olson leads the team in home runs. Ronald Acuna leads the team in runs, hits, and stolen bases. Acuna is top five in the MLB in runs, hits, and stolen bases... CLICK HERE to finish reading and see our PREDICTION on this contest.

Today's Spotlight Game #2
Astros vs Dodgers by Andre' IFill  
 





For anyone with chores on Saturday, take out the trash early. The Houston Astros (41-34) and Los Angeles Dodgers (41-33) are set to bang on Saturday night as they continue their weekend series. Dodger Stadium is hosting, and there won't be a shortage of cameras catching every angle. The first pitch on Saturday is scheduled for 7:15 p.m. EDT and FOX will have the broadcast as they did for their infamous 2017 World Series battle. These two dugouts will do whatever it takes for a win right now, as they are both barely clinging to playoff spots. Let's see the lengths they're willing to go.




There isn't a club in the majors with a lower ERA than the Houston Astros. The bullpen is impressive, with top 10 marks in ERA, FIP, and WAR. However, the starting rotation is how the Astros won it all last season, and they've also been stellar in 2023. Unfortunately, injuries have taken their toll, thrusting Ronel Blanco into the rotation temporarily. As a starter this season, he's thrown 17.0 innings. In that time, he's allowed 17 hits, nine walks, five homers, and nine earned runs. His road ERA is 6.30, mostly due to one disastrous relief appearance in April... CLICK HERE to finish reading and see our PREDICTION on this contest. 

Another day, another solid 2-1 performance from Mike “Big Game” Briggs, running his major league heater to 14-4 in his last 18 Premium Plays. No one has spent more time atop the leaderboard than Briggs and if you haven’t given him a shot, today’s 100% GUARANTEED MLB MAX UNIT MONSTER is the perfect opportunity to do just that. This game goes at 1:10 ET and it is just $24.00. CLICK HERE
Insider's Exclusive Pick
We Got Back On Track Yesterday
Our Freebie yesterday was on the Under 9 in the Minnesota/ Detroit game and it was an easy winner as just five runs were scored in the contest. We will look to Keep It Rolling today with a FREE play from Caleb Davis.  

Free Pick: Angels/ Rockies Over 12











The Angels have been able to hit the long ball well all season, and during night games they've managed to do so even more. Colorado is sitting right around the top 10 in overall batting average and appears to have found their swing of late, racking up 13 runs in their last three games and hitting 21 homers in 20 June contests. Colorado isn't foreign to giving up runs either and with the Angels' ability to drive runners in they should do so. Canning has had ball control issues at times this season and if the Rockies are able to make him work on the mound, they should like their chances to continue their hot hitting. Take the over.

Gut Health & Weight Loss Plan - Role of Supplement,"Hi Maryam,,

Please find the information on the role of the supplements we take during the program.

The Supplements are high quality nutritional support assisting to Heal & Repair our Gut. The three key reasons we have the supplements are:

- The primary reason is to balance your hormones – particularly your insulin levels. (Insulin being responsible for fat uptake in the cells – especially your liver cells). Once your hormones are balanced your body can in fact learn to lose weight and efficiently, and keep it off. As well as with the weight loss you will find your moods become much more stable, anxiety levels decrease, your skin becomes clearer, your head and your thoughts become clearer, and your energy levels will soar (no more naps in the afternoon – it’s very liberating).

- Secondly the nutrition is responsible for cleaning your Gut. The vast majority of illnesses today stem from poor gut flora. Our program will clean up your Gut, allow your villae (finger-like protrusions on the inner wall of your intestine responsible for increasing the surface area for absorption of nutrients into your bloodstream) to stand up and work to their full potential.

- Thirdly, the nutrition is responsible for keeping your skin’s elasticity after the weight loss. (This does depend on how much weight you need to lose, we have had some people lose 60-80kg, and as a result they may need further assistance and treatment for their skin)

This is why supplements are important. The nutrition in the supplements is responsible for supporting your gut. Our program will support your gut, allow your villae (finger-like protrusions on the inner wall of your intestine responsible for increasing the surface area for absorption of nutrients into your blood stream) to stand up and work to their full potential.

The supplements we use for the program are manufactured by M?dere which is well known for using superior products. Their stringent testing is commendable. M?dere products also have a massive absorption rate, up to 90%. Their products work in synergy with each other, which is the reason they are so effective. And they’re all toxin and chemical free, plant based and most importantly they are not weight loss medicines.

This program is a gut-healing program that is extremely successful in such a short time frame due to the synergy between the high absorption quality supplements & the alkaline meal plan. They work hand in hand so that you don’t cause long-term damage & nutritional deficiencies. The awesome results you achieve are because the incredible nutrition works so well with our Alkaline meal plan.

Let me know if you’ve got any questions!

Thanks & Regards",not spam
