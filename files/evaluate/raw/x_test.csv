This week's featured instruments - Indices

 

This week we focus on Index instruments that have blown the charts in the last couple of months. Traders usually diversify their holdings on currency instruments with commodities, stocks and Index instruments. Index instruments include a basket of stocks picked based on the sector, capitalization, or regions. Major Indices from renowned global markets offered at FXPesa include Nasdaq (UT100), Standards and Poor 500 (US500) and Dow Jones (US30) traded at NYSE.

 

S&P500 has been rising since the beginning of the year with more than 15%, as well as Nasdaq pumping to above 30%. The two indices prove the adage that time in the market surpasses timing the market. Recent moves will show fluctuations, but long-term trend shows consistent gains in indices."
